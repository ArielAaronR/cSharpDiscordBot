# cSharpDiscordBot
<p> Custom Discord bot that can perform an array of commands. </p>

<p> The Discord bot can do interact with the user, create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game between users as well as other commands. </p>

<p> Creating custom bots on discord can provide a service to server owners that wish to have custom commands that are not available at the moment. </p>

<p> The technologies I used to make this chat bot was C#, ASP.Net Core, DSharpPlus, and Discord Api </p>
